# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. 
This can, and likely will, change over time. 
In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. 
So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change 
some things later.

## Assignment Description

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Overview: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. 
This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. 
What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

Our app will allow members to record and graph up to 5 symptoms and justapose them on graphs.  
Members will be able to visualize and identify patterns and triggers with graphing. 
Members' data will be saved and linked to member login information for ready access.

### Features
Features: List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project. 
Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence description. 
Here are a few examples for a blog application:

User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. 
Profile: Users will have a profile page that displays symptoms and data.
Select symptoms: Users will select up to 5 symptoms they are interested in tracking.
Rate severity: Users will record severity of an instance.
Record instances: Users will record instances on a date.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Thymeleaf templates
Javascript 
Angular

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here
Our team will be working to better understand and apply javascript and angular methodologies.
We will be reviewing and applying information learned about user accounts, security, data management, 
and front end viewing.  I feel completely lost on everything that I "learned" from the course.  
I do not feel like I have a basic understanding of how to apply any of the pieces I learned and will
have a lot to learn.
